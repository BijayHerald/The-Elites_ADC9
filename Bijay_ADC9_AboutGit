Git init
git init will create a new local GIT repository. The following Git command will create a repository in the current directory:
git init

git Clone
git clone is used to copy a repository. If the repository lies on a remote server, use:
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository
Conversely, run the following basic Git command to copy a local repository:

git clone /path/to/repository

Git commit
git commit will create a snapshot of the changes and save it to the git directory.
git commit –m “Message to go with the commit here”

Git Push
git push is used to send local commits to the master branch of the remote repository. Here’s the basic code structure:
git push origin <master>

Git Pull
git pull merges all the changes present in the remote repository to the local working directory.
git pull

Git Merge
git merge is used to merge a branch into the active one.
git merge <branch-name>

Git Branch
git branch will list, create, or delete branches. For instance, if you want to list all the branches present in the repository, 
the command should look like this:
git branch

Git Config
git config can be used to set user-specific configuration values like email, username, file format, and so on. To illustrate, the command 
for setting up an email will look like this:
git config --global user.email youremail@example.com

Git Fetch
git fetch allows users to fetch all objects from the remote repository that don’t currently reside in the local working directory.
git fetch origin
